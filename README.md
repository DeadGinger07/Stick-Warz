# Stick-Warz
NOTICE: You must install the following pip functions: moviepy (all files relating to it), proglog, subprocess
Note: Some of these may not need to be installed, but you need all of these to get the code to work without any error.
This is 100% a parody of Star Wars made for fun by a group of programmers. This is in no way affiliated with Disney.
In order to run this, please run StickWarz.py
Due to issues with the code, the ending cutscene only works when running it separately.
